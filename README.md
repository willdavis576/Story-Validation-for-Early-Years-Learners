# Story-Validation-for-Early-Years-Learners
This project is to help Tony Davis with his PhD on early year's children's story writing. The project is aimed at checking if a child is able to read a story at a selected reading week in Reception, taking data using SQL from a database that Tony created. This project has a complete GUI using Tkinter and packaged in an exe form.
